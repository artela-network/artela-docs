title: Native Token (ART)
---

## Overview

ART is the native token of the Artela blockchain, a foundational asset essential to the network's operations and growth. Like many other native tokens, ART provides more than just a means of transaction—it acts as a utility, governance, and staking asset, fostering decentralized control and incentivizing active participation in the ecosystem.

## Key Functions of ART

1) Transaction Fees (Gas Payment)
All on-chain activities, such as transferring tokens or executing smart contracts, require ART to pay gas fees. This mechanism ensures that users contribute resources to maintain network operations and avoid spam or malicious activity.

2) Validator Staking and Network Security
ART plays a central role in network security. Validators—entities responsible for validating blocks and maintaining consensus—stake ART to prove their commitment. Users can also delegate ART to these validators, earning rewards proportionate to their staked amount while supporting the blockchain’s security.

3) Governance Participation
ART empowers holders with voting rights, allowing them to influence the blockchain’s development through governance proposals. These proposals can include network upgrades, parameter changes, or community fund allocation. The governance process ensures that Artela evolves based on community consensus rather than centralized decision-making.

4) Ecosystem Incentives
In addition to staking rewards, ART is used to incentivize behaviors that promote network health. For example, voting participants can receive rewards for engaging in governance. This incentivization drives higher participation, ensuring that the network remains decentralized and resilient.

5) Cross-Chain Interoperability
Through IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) support, ART extends its functionality beyond the Artela blockchain. This interoperability makes ART a powerful asset that can interact with other blockchains, enhancing its utility in a multi-chain ecosystem.
