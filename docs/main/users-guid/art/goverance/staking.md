Artela’s network consists of multiple Validators, and you can view the number of active Validators and related network parameters on the Status page. In the current testnet, the maximum number of Validators is set at 30. On the Staking page, you’ll find a list of active Validators, and ART token holders can delegate their tokens to these Validators to earn network rewards.

In the My Balance section, you can check your ART balance, the amount you’ve staked, and the rewards you’ve accumulated. The Undelegate section displays the ART tokens currently in the unbonding process.

In the My Wallet section, you can view:

- Your current ART balance
- Total staked amount
- Accumulated rewards
- Tokens in the Undelegates
- Current inflation rate

You can also check your staking history with Validators and choose to Delegate or Redelegate to other Validators. Rewards will accumulate with each block, and you can claim them as they become available.
