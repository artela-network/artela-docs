Artela adopts a staking-based voting model, where participants earn voting power by staking their $ART tokens. Each ART token represents one vote, and users can cast votes on different proposals to influence system upgrades and key decisions. The more $ART tokens you stake, the greater your voting weight. Future blogs will further explain the governance operations and implementation.

Proposal topics include but are not limited to:

- The network's inflation rate
- Application of slashing parameters
- Distribution of rewards
- Quorum levels required for decisions
- The duration of the unbonding period

During the testnet phase, you can visit the Governance page to review active proposals and cast your votes. The “voting” section shows current proposals, while the “passed” section displays approved historical proposals, and the “rejected” section shows those that were not passed.
