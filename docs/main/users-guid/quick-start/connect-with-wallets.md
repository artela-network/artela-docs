# Connect Artela Blockchain with Wallets

This section will guide you through connecting to the Artela blockchain using popular wallets such as MetaMask and other EVM-compatible wallets. By following these steps, youâ€™ll be able to add the Artela network, manage your assets, and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) on the network.

## 1. Connect to Artela with MetaMask  
MetaMask is a widely-used browser extension wallet that supports EVM-compatible networks like Artela. Follow these steps to get started:  

### Step 1: Install MetaMask  
- Download the MetaMask extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/).  
- Create a new wallet or import an existing one.  

### Step 2: Add the Artela Network to MetaMask  
- Open MetaMask and click the network dropdown at the top.  
- Select **"Add Network"** and fill in the following details:
```bash
Network Name: Artela
RPC URL: [https://api.artela.network]
Chain ID: [artela_11820-1]
Currency Symbol: [ART]
Block Explorer URL: [https://art-scan.artela.network/]
```

- Click **"Save"** to add the Artela network.

### Step 3: Connect MetaMask to Artela DApps  
- Once connected, you can now access Artela DApps directly through your browser. MetaMask will prompt you to approve any transaction you initiate.

## 2. Using Other EVM-Compatible Wallets  
In addition to MetaMask, Artela supports other EVM-compatible wallets like:
- **OKX Wallet**
- **Trust Wallet**  
- **Rabby Wallet**

The process for these wallets is similar:  
1. Navigate to the **network settings** in your wallet.  
2. Add the Artela network by entering the RPC, Chain ID, and other required details.  
3. Confirm and switch to the Artela network to start interacting.

## 3. Verify Wallet Connection  
After connecting your wallet, ensure it is properly linked by checking:  
- Your Artela wallet address is displayed correctly in the wallet interface.  
- The network shows the correct chain name (Artela).  
- You can view your balance and initiate transactions smoothly.

After setting up your wallet, you can acquire ART tokens by [Birdge](bridge-to-artela) to begin interacting with DApps, sending transactions, and participating in governance activities with ease.
