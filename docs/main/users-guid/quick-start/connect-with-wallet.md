# Connect with Wallet

This section will guide you through connecting to the Artela blockchain using popular wallets such as MetaMask and other EVM-compatible wallets. By following these steps, youâ€™ll be able to add the Artela network, manage your assets, and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) on the network.

## 1. Connect with MetaMask

MetaMask is a widely-used browser extension wallet that supports EVM-compatible networks like Artela. Follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Install MetaMask

- Download the MetaMask extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/).  
- Create a new wallet or import an existing one.  

### Step 2: Add the Artela Network

- Open MetaMask and click the network dropdown at the top.  
- Select **"Add Network"** and fill in the following details:

    | Network Name        | Artela                           |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------|
    | RPC URL             | https://api.artela.network       |
    | Chain ID            | `artela_11820-1`                 |
    | Currency Symbol     | `ART`                            |
    | Block Explorer URL  | https://art-scan.artela.network/ |

### Step 3: Connect MetaMask to DApps

Once connected, you can now access Artela DApps directly through your browser. MetaMask will prompt you to approve any transaction you initiate.

## 2. Using Other EVM-Compatible Wallets

In addition to MetaMask, Artela supports other EVM-compatible wallets like:

- OKX Wallet
- Trust Wallet
- Rabby Wallet

The process for these wallets is similar:

1. Navigate to the **network settings** in your wallet.  
2. Add the Artela network by entering the RPC, Chain ID, and other required details.  
3. Confirm and switch to the Artela network to start interacting.

## 3. Verify Wallet Connection

After connecting your wallet, ensure it is properly linked by checking:

- Your Artela wallet address is displayed correctly in the wallet interface,
- The network shows the correct chain name (Artela),
- You can view your balance and initiate transactions smoothly.

After setting up your wallet, you can acquire ART tokens by [Birdge](bridge-to-artela) to begin interacting with DApps, sending transactions, and participating in governance activities with ease.
