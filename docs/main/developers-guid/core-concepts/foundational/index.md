# Foundational Topics

Artela is a layer-1 blockchain network that empowers developers to leverage Aspect Programming. This innovative approach allows for the construction of native extensions in WebAssembly (WASM), working together with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to deliver enhanced and customized functionalities.

Artela boasts full compatibility with Ethereum, ensuring a seamless transition for developers. This means that you can effortlessly deploy your EVM-based decentralized applications (dApps) on Artela. While Artela inherits several fundamental blockchain concepts from Ethereum, it also introduces unique features that set it apart.
