# Writing Solidity Smart Contract on Artela

If you're eager to get started with Solidity smart contracts on Artela, follow these concise steps to create and deploy your smart contract using **Remix**:

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Begin by accessing the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) through this URL: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New Contract**: In Remix IDE, use the plus icon on the left to initiate a new smart contract. For instance, name your file "MyContract.sol" and craft your smart contract code within it.

3. **Compile Your Smart Contract**: Find the "Solidity compiler" icon in the left menu, then click "Compile." Remix will take care of compiling your smart contract code.

4. **Configure Metamask**: If you haven't already, install the Metamask browser plugin. Once installed, select a test network, such as the Artela test network, within Metamask. This ensures you're operating within a safe testing environment for your smart contract.

5. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**: Back in Remix IDE, locate and click the "Deploy & run transactions" icon on the left. In the "Environment" options, choose "Injected Web3." This setting connects Remix to your Metamask wallet. Now, click "Deploy," and Remix will initiate the deployment of your smart contract.

6. **Confirm Deployment**: Metamask will present a confirmation window. To complete the deployment process on the Artela test network, click "Confirm."

7. **Verify Deployment**: Within the Remix IDE's "Deploy & run transactions" panel, you can inspect your newly deployed smart contracts. Simply click on the contract address to access comprehensive contract details. Additionally, soon, you'll be able to explore further contract details in the Artela blockchain explorer.

These streamlined steps provide a solid foundation for crafting and deploying your Solidity smart contract using Remix on Artela. Should you encounter any challenges, consult Remix and Metamask's official documentation or seek assistance within the supportive Artela community.

With your smart contract successfully deployed, you're now ready to delve into the exciting realm of blockchain development on the Artela platform.
