# Init Project

## Introduce

The `@artela/aspect-tool init ` command helps developers generate a scaffold for Aspect project development based on the
AssemblyScript language. This scaffold comes with dependencies from the Artela library, including essential development
libraries and common scripts. It supports operations such as compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts and
WebAssembly, thereby enhancing efficiency in blockchain development.  
This guide outlines the process of initiating an Aspect development project


## Init Project

```shell

mkdir my-first-aspect && cd  my-first-aspect

npm install -g @artela/aspect-tool

aspect-tool init
```

## Project 

### Structure

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── asconfig.json
├── aspect                   <-- Your aspect code resides here
│   └── index.ts       <-- Entry functions for the aspect
├── contracts                <-- Place your smart contracts here
├── package.json
├── project.config.json
├── scripts                  <-- Utility scripts, including deploying, binding and etc.
│   ├── aspect-deploy.cjs
│   ├── bind.cjs
│   ├── contract-call.cjs
│   ├── contract-deploy.cjs
│   ├── contract-send.cjs
│   └── create-account.cjs
├── tests
└── tsconfig.json

```

The command automatically creates the recommended directory structure and configuration files:

* `./aspect`  Directory used to store the aspect you wrote. this sources being compiled to WebAssembly, more details to learn [how to write an aspect](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/aspect-structure).

* `./aspect/index.ts` Default entry file being compiled to WebAssembly to get you started.

* `./scripts/*.cjs` Aspects and contract compilation, deployment, binding, and other scripts.
