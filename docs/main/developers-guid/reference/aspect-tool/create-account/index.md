## Customize

The logic for the create-account command is written in the `scripts/create-account.cjs` file, primarily relying on the
implementation provided by the [@artela/web3](/develop/client/artela-web3.js) API.   
If needed, you can modify the logic within this file to achieve your specific functionalities.
