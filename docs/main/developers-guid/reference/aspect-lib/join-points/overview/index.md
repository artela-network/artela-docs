# Transaction Join Point

## Introduction

The Transaction Level Aspect defines multiple Join Points, with each one representing a distinct state transition
function at a specific stage in the [transaction lifecycle](/develop/core-concepts/lifecycle),
it needs to be binding a smart contract and activated by EOA transactions.

The current transaction is delivered to the Evm module, and Transactions are applied according to Geth's execution
logic `ApplyTransaction` ⮕ `ApplyMessage` ⮕ `evm. Call`, In this process, additional Join Points are executed, and the
process is shown in the following call graph.

## How to Create a Transaction-Level Aspect

A complete aspect should include several components. Firstly, create your class as an implementation of the aspect.
Then, import and inherit based on the join point you want to implement into your aspect, and fill in your own logic to
implement these functions. The IsOwner method, serving as the permission management part of your aspect, must be
implemented. Next, register your aspect class with aspect-libs. Finally, your code should include the imports and
exports used by aspect-runtime, as well as the components that your aspect must contain.

For the given code snippet, where MyAspect is my aspect class:

1. Mandatory implementations include:

<!-- @formatter:off -->
```typescript
import { entryPoint, execute, allocate } from "@artela/aspect-libs";
...
class MyAspect {
  isOwner(sender: Uint8Array): bool {
    // your logic here
  }
  ...
}
...
const aspect = new MyAspect();
entryPoint.setAspect(aspect);
export { execute, allocate }
```
<!-- @formatter:on -->

2. Optional implementations may include, for example, if you want to implement join point `preTxExecute`

<!-- @formatter:off -->
```typescript
import { PreTxExecuteInput, IPreTxExecuteJP } from "@artela/aspect-libs";
...
class MyAspect implements IPreTxExecuteJP {
  preTxExecute(input: PreTxExecuteInput): void {
    // you logic here
  }
}
```
<!-- @formatter:on -->

A complete example is as follows.
<!-- @formatter:off -->
```typescript

import {
  entryPoint,
  execute,
  allocate,

  TxVerifyInput,
  PreTxExecuteInput,
  PreContractCallInput,

  ITransactionVerifier,
  IPreTxExecuteJP,
  IPreContractCallJP,
  IPostContractCallJP,
  IPostTxExecuteJP,
  IAspectOperation,
} from "@artela/aspect-libs";

class MyAspect implements ITransactionVerifier,
        IPreTxExecuteJP,
        IPreContractCallJP,
        IPostContractCallJP,
        IPostTxExecuteJP,

## Join Point Description

Next, we will provide a detailed description of each method in the IAspectTransaction interface. You can click on the
links associated with each method name to access more detailed information. It is recommended to have a prior
understanding of [the concept of Joinpoints](/develop/core-concepts/join-point).

1. IsOwner

> It is the governance account implemented by the Aspect, when any of the governance operation (
>
including [bind](/develop/core-concepts/lifecycle#binding), [unbinding](/develop/core-concepts/lifecycle#unbinding), ...)
> is made, isOwner method will be invoked to check against the initiator's account to make sure it has the permission.

2. [VerifyTx](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/join-points/verify-aspect)

> Aspect can provide transaction verification service when bound to certain dApp and EoA. If an Aspect has been bound to
> certain dApp and EoA as a transaction verifier, instead of doing the legacy secp256k1 signature verification, Aspect
> will replace it with the customized verification logic implemented in the verifyTx method.

3. [PreTxExecute](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/join-points/pre-tx-execute)

> Triggered prior to the transaction execution. At this stage, the account state remains pristine, allowing Aspect to
> preload information as necessary.

4. [PreContractCall](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/join-points/pre-contract-call)

> Triggered before the execution of the cross-contract call. For example, during a TX execution, Uniswap contract calls
> into Maker contract, the Aspect will be executed.

5. [PostContractCall](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/join-points/post-contract-call)

> Triggered after the cross-contract call is executed. The Aspect can then inspect the post-call state of the contract
> and make subsequent execution decisions.

6. [PostTxExecute](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/join-points/post-tx-execute)

> Activated once the transaction has been executed and the account states have been finalized. Subsequently, Aspect can
> conduct a comprehensive review of the final execution state.

7. [Operation](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/operation)

> Operation is a special interface. Unlike other join points, which are triggered during transaction execution, this
> interface can be called directly by an operation transaction signed by EoA. The operation transaction will trigger the
> execution of the Aspect.
