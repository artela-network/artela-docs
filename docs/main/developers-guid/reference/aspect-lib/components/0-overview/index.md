## Overview

This library simplifies and enhances Aspect application development, offering tools to boost developer productivity and ensure code type safety. It provides low-level API access to system data and contextual information generated during blockchain runtime, covering environment details, blocks, transactions, and utility classes such as crypto, ABI encoding/decoding, and other utilities.

## Components

* **[sys](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/components/sys)**
> Provides essential system-level functionalities, including log, revert, require, etc.

* [sys.hostApi](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/components/sys-hostapi)
> Offers a low-level interface for exchanging data with blockchain workers.

* [sys.aspect](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/components/sys-aspect)
> Provides data query and update operations for Aspect State and Property.

* [ethereum](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/components/ethereum)
> Delivers Ethereum smart contract functionality, along with ABI (Application Binary Interface) handling, encoding/decoding, and utility classes.

* [helper](/develop/reference/aspect-lib/components/helper)
> This Helper provides utility functions for smooth data type conversions, ensuring compatibility and simplifying the management of data transformations in your software application. Whether handling numeric, string, or other data representations, this Helper enhances overall flexibility and interoperability in your codebase.
