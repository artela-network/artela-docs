# Other Clients


## Ethereum Client Support

Web3.js and Ethers.js are the two most commonly used libraries in decentralized application (dApp) development. Developers utilize these libraries to interact with the blockchain and query JSON-RPC data. Additionally, both of these libraries contain various tools to assist with tasks such as handling large numbers, such as BigNumber operations.

- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) Web3.js is collection of libraries enables interaction with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket protocols.
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/) Ethers.js is the latest JavaScript library designed to provide full compatibility and efficiency when interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.

## Development Tools Support

- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) Remix is a free browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It simplifies the process of developing decentralized applications (dApps) by offering a user-friendly interface for creating and deploying smart contracts. Using Remix, developers can write, test, and deploy smart contracts in Solidity. It also features debugging tools and a simulation environment for testing contracts before deploying them to the blockchain. Additionally, Remix supports various plugins.
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/) Truffle offers a comprehensive set of tools to simplify the smart contract development process, enabling easy testing and deployment on any EVM network, such as the Artela Network, using JavaScript/TypeScript. 
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) Hardhat is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that enables comprehensive testing, development, and deployment of smart contracts.
