## For Users:

### 1. Seamless Integration of EVM and Cosmos Ecosystems
Artela supports the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, allowing users to interact with dApps on Artela using familiar Ethereum tools like MetaMask, Remix, and more. Additionally, Artela integrates the **Cosmos ecosystem**, enabling users to utilize **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)** for cross-chain asset and data transfers between Cosmos and Artela. This fusion lets users experience the best of both worlds, accessing Ethereum functionalities alongside Cosmos’ efficient cross-chain capabilities.

### 2. Enhanced EVM Functionality
Beyond basic EVM compatibility, Artela extends EVM features, providing users with enhanced functionalities like an optimized gas fee structure and faster transaction finality. Artela aims to offer users a more efficient and powerful experience than Ethereum, ensuring smoother transactions and dApp interactions with improved scalability.

### 3. Broad Ecosystem Support
Artela supports a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and cross-chain solutions. Whether you are involved in **DeFi**, **NFTs**, or managing cross-chain assets, Artela provides a one-stop solution tailored to your needs.

For detailed usage, please refer to the [Users Guide](/new/users-guid).

## For Developers:

### 1. Diverse and Compatible Development Tools
Artela is highly developer-friendly, supporting various tools from both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. Developers can use tools like **Remix, Truffle, Hardhat** to write, deploy, and test smart contracts, while also leveraging Cosmos SDK's modular architecture to develop dApps. This dual support allows developers to migrate Ethereum smart contracts to Artela seamlessly and expand dApp functionality using Cosmos’ efficient cross-chain modules.

### 2. Aspect Programming
Artela introduces an innovative programming model known as **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**, which enables developers to add functionalities and logic layers without modifying the original contract code. AOP allows developers to dynamically adjust contract behavior during execution by injecting "aspects," making it easier to implement complex business logic and security features. For developers looking to build rich, feature-packed dApps, AOP is a powerful tool. Refer to the [Developers Guide](https://docs.artela.network/developers-guid) for more details.

### 3. Cross-Chain Scalability Solutions
As part of the Cosmos ecosystem, Artela supports the **IBC cross-chain communication protocol**, allowing developers to easily integrate cross-chain functionalities. Whether it’s asset transfers or cross-chain smart contract calls, Artela offers a robust infrastructure for developers. Additionally, Artela’s EVM extension enables more complex contract logic, providing developers with the tools to build applications beyond Ethereum’s standard capabilities.

### 4. Optimized Smart Contract Execution Environment
Artela’s smart contract execution environment is optimized for better performance, offering lower gas fees and higher execution efficiency. Developers can continue to write smart contracts in **Solidity**, while also leveraging Artela's extended EVM capabilities to develop applications with a competitive edge over Ethereum. The architecture also supports fast transaction finality and high throughput, ensuring low-latency interactions for users and dApps alike.
