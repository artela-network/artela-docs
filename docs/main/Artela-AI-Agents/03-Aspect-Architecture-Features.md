# Aspect Architecture

![nighty_p](./img/architecture-1.png)

Artela’s **Aspect architecture** allows AI Agents to run fully on-chain by providing all the necessary components:

- **AANE (Aspect Agent Native Extension)**:
    
    The core extension module for AI Agents, enabling real-time state synchronization on-chain, event-driven actions based on on-chain data, data availability (DA) and recovery modules.
    
- **AI Agent Runtime**:
    
    AI Agents can operate directly on the blockchain in the Aspect runtime, including essential modules such as character system, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and Action System.
    
- **On-Chain LLMs**:
    
    AI Agents can use Ollama-based LLMs deployed directly in the Aspect Nodes, eliminating the need for centralized model deployment.
    
- **State Management & Decentralized KMS**:
    
    AI Agents have their own **state** on-chain, including meta-information about the agent's identity, long-term memory to store experiences and learn over time, assets and wallets securely managed with a decentralized Key Management System (KMS).
