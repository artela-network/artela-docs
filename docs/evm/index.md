# Overview

Artela EVM is the only available EVM stack in Cosmos and Celestia modular ecosystem.

Artela's vision is to unlock the extensibility and scalability of EVM blockchains through the EVM++ paradigm, creating a new decentralized application runtime environment that accelerates the integration of innovative technology scenarios into the crypto world. 

üîç We are engaged in long-term research and exploration of:

- High-performance EVM execution layers, covering technologies like parallel execution and parallel storage.
- Launching high-performance EVMs in the modular/Cosmos/Celestia ecosystem.


## üåü What are we building

Artela is built upon a popular tech stack: Cosmos SDK, EVM (Geth), Wasmtime, IBC, and Rollkit.

Building on these foundations, Artela continues to develop EVM++, a high-performance, highly extensible modular execution layer that supports parallel execution and interoperable VMs.


## üöß We provide long-term maintenance for:

- [Arteal L1](https://artela.network/): Artela's main network, an EVM++ Layer 1 network.
- [EVM on Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/artela-network/artela): A continuously integrated EVM codebase that includes the latest updates to Cosmos SDK / IBC / EVM (Geth). If you wish to build an EVM-compatible chain based on Cosmos SDK like Artela, this is a viable option.
- [EVM Rollkit](https://github.com/artela-network/artela-rollkit): EVM on Rollkit, a continuously integrated Rollkit EVM codebase that includes the latest updates to Rollkit / Cosmos SDK / IBC / EVM (Geth). If you want to build an EVM-compatible chain based on Cosmos SDK like Artela, this is also a viable choice.
