# Launching a Wallet on EVM++

This guide explains how to set up and connect your MetaMask wallet to the Artela EVM++ chain. Follow these steps to access and manage your assets on the chain.

---

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

1. **Download MetaMask**
   - Install the MetaMask browser extension or mobile app from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).

2. **Create or Import a Wallet**
   - If you are new to MetaMask, create a wallet and securely store the recovery phrase.
   - If you already have a wallet, use the "Import Wallet" option to access it.

## Step 2: Configure the Artela EVM++ Network

To connect MetaMask to the Artela EVM++ chain, you need to manually add the network:

1. Open MetaMask and click on the network selector (top-right corner).
2. Select **"Add Network"** (or **"Add Network Manually"**).
3. Enter the following network details:

   - **Network Name:** Artela EVM++
   - **RPC URL:** `https://rpc.artela.network`
   - **Chain ID:** `11820` (Note that the chain ID of the artela EVM++ chain is the middle part of the chain ID in the configured cosmos format, such as 11820 of artroll_11820-1)
   - **Currency Symbol:** ART
   - **Block Explorer URL:** `https://explorer.artela.network`

4. Save the network configuration.

MetaMask will switch to the Artela EVM++ network automatically.

## Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

1. **Acquire ART Tokens**
   - If you are testing, use the Artela faucet to obtain test ART tokens.
   - If on the mainnet, acquire ART tokens from supported exchanges or other sources.

2. **Transfer Tokens**
   - Share your wallet address with the sender.
   - Use Artela's explorer to verify token transfers.

---

## Step 4: Verify Wallet Connection

1. Open MetaMask and ensure the selected network is Artela EVM++.
2. Check your wallet balance for ART tokens.
3. Use Artela-compatible decentralized applications (DApps) to confirm the connection.

## Troubleshooting

- **RPC Errors:** Double-check the RPC URL and network details.
- **No ART Tokens:** Ensure your wallet is funded or access the faucet for test tokens.
- **Connection Issues:** Restart MetaMask or your browser and try again.
